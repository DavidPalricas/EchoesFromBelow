# Les Catacombes

## Game Overview

In this exploration and 2D top down adventure game, you play as an explorer who, during an expedition through the mysterious Catacombs of Paris, gets separated from the group after choosing an alternate path. This choice leads to an unexpected fall, dropping you into an even darker, more isolated part of the underground maze. Now, your main objective is to survive and find a way out.

As you navigate oppressive, ancient corridors, you'll face fantastical creatures, gather resources, and struggle to stay alive.
